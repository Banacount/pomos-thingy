# About this program
This is just a basic pomodoro app. Styling
of this program is made to be very minimal.
Inspired by the website [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)
but a more minimal and offline version of it.  

> You could also change the sfx and font family
just rename it to the corresponding init file name.
For now it only supports these formats: mp3, ttf.
